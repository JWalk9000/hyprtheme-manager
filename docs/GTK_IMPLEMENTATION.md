# GTK Theme Manager - Complete Implementation

## Overview
Successfully transformed the theme manager from a rofi-based command-line interface to a modern native GTK4/Libadwaita application, following the ML4W Hyprland Settings design paradigm as requested.

## Key Components

### 1. Main GTK Application (`main.py`)
- **Architecture**: GTK4 + Libadwaita following ML4W design patterns
- **Features**:
  - Modern preference groups and action rows
  - Real-time wallpaper selection with preview
  - Interactive color palette with click-to-copy functionality
  - Background threading for non-blocking operations
  - Toast notifications for user feedback
  - Proper desktop integration

### 2. Application Classes
- **ThemeManagerApplication**: Main application controller with actions
- **ThemeManagerWindow**: Primary interface with status, wallpaper, and color sections
- **AppConfigWindow**: Preferences dialog for application configuration
- **WallpaperDownloadWindow**: Repository download interface

### 3. Desktop Integration
- **Launcher Script**: `theme-manager-gtk` - Executable entry point
- **Desktop Entry**: `theme-manager-gtk.desktop` - System integration
- **Icon Support**: Uses system symbolic icons throughout

## UI Sections

- User-friendly error messages via toasts
- Robust file and process handling

### Integration
- Seamless integration with existing backend modules
- Clean wallpaper utilities without rofi dependencies
- Preserves template_manager functionality
- Uses config_manager for persistent settings

## Launch and Usage

### Quick Start
```bash
# Launch GTK application
/home/zeus/.config/Theme-Manager/theme-manager-gtk

# Or run demo
/home/zeus/.config/Theme-Manager/demo-gtk.sh
```

### Desktop Integration
The application is fully integrated into the desktop environment with:
- Native window management
- System theme adaptation
- Proper application lifecycle
- Standard keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Q to quit)

## Design Philosophy
Following the ML4W Hyprland Settings approach:
- Clean, modern interface using Libadwaita widgets
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Logical grouping with preference groups
- Action-oriented design with clear CTAs
- Progressive disclosure for advanced features
- Responsive layout that adapts to window size

## Transformation Summary
**From**: Rofi-based command-line interface with limited interactivity
**To**: Full-featured native GTK4/Libadwaita application with modern UX

This represents a complete "gear change" as requested, moving from terminal-based interaction to a sophisticated graphical interface that matches the quality and design patterns of ML4W Hyprland Settings.

The application now provides an intuitive, visual way to manage themes while maintaining all the powerful backend functionality of the original system.
